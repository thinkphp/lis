# Longest Increasing Subsequence

  In computer science, the longest increasing subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence
  in which the subsequence's elements are in sorted order, lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible.
  This subsequence aren't necessarily contiguos or unique.
